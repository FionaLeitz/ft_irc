  Parameters: <channel> [<topic>]

	1.	If <topic> is not given (check topic) :
		- either RPL_TOPIC or RPL_NOTOPIC is returned specifying the current channel topic or
		lack of one
			- if RPL_TOPIC is returned to the client sending this command, RPL_TOPICWHOTIME SHOULD also be sent to that client.
	2. 	If <topic> is an empty string (clear topic):
		- the topic for the channel will be cleared
		- every client in that channel (including the author of the topic change) will receive a TOPIC command with an
		empty argument alerting them to how the topic has changed
		- clients joining the channel in the future will receive a RPL_TOPIC numeric (or lack thereof) accordingly
	3. Else (set topic):
		- every client in that channel (including the author of the topic change) will receive a TOPIC command with the
		new topic as argument alerting them to how the topic has changed.
		- clients joining the channel in the future will receive a RPL_TOPIC numeric (or lack thereof) accordingly
	
	- If the client sending this command is not joined to the given channel, and tries to view itsâ€™ topic, the server
		MAY return the ERR_NOTONCHANNEL (442) numeric and have the command fail.
	(-  If the protected topic mode is set on a channel, then clients MUST have appropriate channel permissions to modify
		the topic of that channel. If a client does not have appropriate channel permissions and tries to change the
			topic, the ERR_CHANOPRIVSNEEDED (482) numeric is returned and the command will fail.)
